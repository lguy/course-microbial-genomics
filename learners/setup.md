## Summary

These pages contain instructions for computer lab part of the lectures on microbial evolution and epidemiology. The exercises are to be performed either on a web browser or on Uppmax.

In the first 2 episodes, you'll be mostly working on web-based exercises. In episodes 3-4, you'll practice multiple sequence alignment and building phylogenies, based on single genes. 

Episodes 5-9 explore, with real data, an outbreak of tuberculosis, going from raw reads to inferring hypotheses about transmission. 

## Software Setup

You will use the same setup as for the Linux tutorial. See the corresponding page on Studium. 

## Data Sets

Data for the molecular epidemiology part comes from [Bryant et al., 2013](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-110)
