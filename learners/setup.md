These pages contain instruction for the demonstration part of the lectures on 
microbial evolution, phylogenetics and molecular epidemiology. The demos
are to be performed inside the virtual machine already installed in your 
computer. 

## Data Sets

FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop
